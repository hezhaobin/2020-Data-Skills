# 2020-04-17 Download sequence, analysis on Benchling
1. See `data/README.md` for details on sequence downloads
1. The fasta sequences are uploaded onto Benchling, in a folder for Justin's project.
1. Also uploaded MG772934 sequences, which was from NCBI nucleotide database under that accession.
1. Attempted to create a multiple alignment for all 8 sequences + the annotated MG772934, failed in Benchling. Maybe over the length limit. However, aligning one sequence at a time to MG772934 worked. Later can try Jalview or command line tools for alignment.
